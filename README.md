This code was developed to find the optimal crack path from a set of point clouds. 
The foremost motivation is to find the discrete crack topology from the smeared crack phase-field, see our [publication](https://doi.org/10.1002/nme.7249)  by Yue Xu, Tao You and Qizhi Zhu.
In addition to basic supervised learning algorithms used for crack path identification, the [frictional phase-field model](https://doi.org/10.1002/nme.6242) proposed by Fan and Choo was also implemented using pure Julia language.

If you want to run a case, please start with the main file: 'excute-2d.jl' after building the Julia env in your local machine. We have run this code in our Windows system.
